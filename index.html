	<center><body>Black Lives Matter is movement for the end of police brutality, thousands of black me and women are killed each year due to racists or police brutality. In 2020, there were only 18 days were there wasnt any police brutality. One person who was recently killed by police Daunte Wright, Daunte was arrested on April 11th because he had a air freshener that was "blocking his frontal mirror". He was told to get out of his car so they could arrest him. He tried to escape from the police, and instead of the police grabbing her taser, she instead grabbed her gun.After she fatally shot him, she proceeds to say "I shot him.", the police do nothing to check on him. Daunte Wright was only 20.</body></center>
