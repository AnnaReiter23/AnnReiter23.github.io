Black Lives MatterdisplayBlack Lives Matter is movement for the end of police brutality, thousands of black me and women are killed each year due to racists or police brutality. In 2020, there were only 18 days were there wasnt any police brutality. One person who was recently killed by police Daunte Wright, Daunte was arrested on April 11th because he had a air freshener that was "blocking his frontal mirror". He was told to get out of his car so they could arrest him. He tried to escape from the police, and instead of the police grabbing her taser, she instead grabbed her gun.After she fatally shot him, she proceeds to say "I shot him.", the police do nothing to check on him. Daunte Wright was only 20.</body></center>

	<p>This is Daunte Wright. He was only 20 when he got fatally shot by officer Kim Potter. Kim had been a veteran and knew exactly where her gun was. She ssays it was an "accident" but officals say other wise. There have been many protests in recent times to try and stop police brutality but they have been shut down. There has been a curfew put out in Minnesota to keep protests from going on. Many people say that protests are bad, but most say that because theyve only seen the riots and not the peaceful part.</p>
